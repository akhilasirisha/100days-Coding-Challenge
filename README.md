# 100 Days Coding Challenge - TalentBattle

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey with the TalentBattle platform! 🚀 Over the next 100 days, I will be solving daily coding problems, starting from basic to advanced, with a focus on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. My preferred language for this challenge is **Java** ☕️.

## 🏁 Challenge Details

- **Platform**: TalentBattle
- **Duration**: 100 Days
- **Start Date**: [Your Start Date]
- **Focus Areas**:
  - General coding problems
